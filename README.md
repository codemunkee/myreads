# MyReads Project

This is the first project for (https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)[Udacity's React Nanodegree]. 

It uses basic React v4 functionality also relying on `react-router-dom` for routing.

https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router

The API it hits behind the scenes is for testing purposes only and is limited in what queries it will respond to (with respect to available books).

We also use `deep-extend` to solve issues where the API response objects don't contain all of the properties we expect by default.
