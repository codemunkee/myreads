# MyReads Project

This is the first project for [Udacity's React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019). 

It uses basic React functionality also relying on `react-router-dom` for routing.

The API it hits behind the scenes is for testing purposes only and is limited in what queries it will respond to (with respect to available books). Checkout `SEARCH_TERMS.md` for the specific search terms that are supported.

We also use `deep-extend` to solve issues where the API response objects don't contain all of the properties we expect by default.
